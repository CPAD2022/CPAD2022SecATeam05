# lunch_on

Lunch_On is an application where corporate employees can place food order during their lunch time.
This promotes a sustainable way of placing order instead of paper reciepts.
The application is based out of Flutter using Dart and works on Web, Android, Mac OS and IOS   

Update: While presenting, we were asked to add the filter and qr functionality. We successfuly added the qr functionality in our application and built the logic for the filter functionality.   

## Getting Started


1) Clone the repository.  
2) Open the directory in Terminal.   
3) Run the command 'flutter run lib/main.dart'    

This will open the flutter application in the chrome browser.
